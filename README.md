Stuff I'm currently teaching myself:
- Go

Motivation:
- Programming is fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- MIT/others: When things aren't black or white.

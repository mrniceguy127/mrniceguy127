## Project Status
### In Progress
- [NES Emulator](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/nes-emu)
- [GPU Accelerated Mandelbrot Generator](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/mandelbrot-gen)
  - Frame generator on seperate branch
  - For especially deep zooms, I'm going to need an algorithm that doesn't rely on the precision of floating point types.

### On Hold
- [Castlevania III Save Password Generator](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/castlevania-iii-password-save-gen-c-sharp)
  - TDD Practice. Less-familiar language is intentional.
  - Might be able to test on my NES emulator, who knows!

### Future Projects
*\* Feasiblility already researched. Is feasible.*

*\*\* Feasible, but possibly not challenging enough without extension*
- \*\* AES Implementation *(For fun. Not intended to be used in a "real world" scenario.)*

## Books I'm Reading / Will Read
- [Go Programming Language, The (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=golang&qid=1635724747&sr=8-9) (On hold, too busy)
- [The Ruby Programming Language: Everything You Need to Know 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-Everything-Need-ebook/dp/B0026OR3JO/ref=sr_1_4?crid=237J648G56NIM&dchild=1&keywords=ruby+programming&qid=1635881146&s=digital-text&sprefix=ruby+pro%2Cdigital-text%2C146&sr=1-4) (This will come after Go)

## Motivation
- Programming is fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Career path

## How I pick licenses
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- MIT/others/multi-license: When things aren't black or white. Especially when working with other people where goals, motivation, and opinions may differ.
- Strongly reconsidering my opinions at the moment to always require attribution. Using MIT made it easy for someone to plagiarize my work. Fun.

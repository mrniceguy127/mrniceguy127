Stuff I'm currently teaching myself:
- [Go](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=golang&qid=1635724747&sr=8-9)
- [Ruby]() (This will come after Go)
- Anything related to my current projects

Motivation:
- Programming is fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Career Path

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- MIT/others/multi-license: When things aren't black or white. Especially when working with other people where goals, motivation, and opinions may differ.

Updates:
- [03/05/2021] Taking a break from my side projects so I can focus on school, co-op, and other life matters.
- [10/18/2021] I'm finally back and able to continue my side projects again.

### Hi! I want to make a career out of my hobby.

UPDATE 2/19/2021

**Focusing on school for now. Status is where I left off.**

Status:
- Ideas also brewing related to RetroArch, though I'm not certain yet.
- mandelbrot-gen: Tinkering... Zooms work.
- I generally like to get started on things before saying them, but I'm probably going to try and implement an AES encryption algorithm in C# for learning purposes. Not real world use!!!
- osu-wine-install-script: Will soon add script for installing ThePoon's wine patch / other improvements.
- Too many ideas in the works too! Like Castlevania III related stuff.

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation and I generally don't want derivative work to be made proprietary. 
- MIT: When things aren't black or white.

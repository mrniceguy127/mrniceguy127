## Projects Status

Status: Doing things when I have motivation.

### Intermediary Personal Projects Status
- In Progress
  - 6502 Emulation
- On Hold
  - [Castlevania III Save Password Generator](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/castlevania-iii-password-save-gen-c-sharp)
    - TDD Practice. Also C# learning/practice.
  - [GPU Accelerated Mandelbrot Fractal Generator](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/mandelbrot-gen)
    - TODO: Frame generator on a separate branch. Works, but needs documentation and improvement.
    - TODO: For especially deep zooms, I will need an algorithm that doesn't rely on the precision of floating point types.
- Future Projects (*\* Feasible, but needs extension to make it more challenging)
  - \* AES Implementation

### Long-Term Personal Projects
- [Rockwell 6502 Emulation (future NES emulator hopefully)](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/nes-emu)
  - TODO: load program to 6502, and finish testing it.
  - TODO: All other components.

## Stuff I'm Learning / Plan To Learn
- Rust
- [The Ruby Programming Language: Everything You Need to Know 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-Everything-Need-ebook/dp/B0026OR3JO/ref=sr_1_4?crid=237J648G56NIM&dchild=1&keywords=ruby+programming&qid=1635881146&s=digital-text&sprefix=ruby+pro%2Cdigital-text%2C146&sr=1-4) (This will come after Rust)
- [Go Programming Language, The (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=golang&qid=1635724747&sr=8-9)

## Motivation
- Programming is fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Career path
- Easily fixated

## How I pick licenses
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open-source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- Others/multi-license: When things aren't black or white. Especially when working with other people where goals, motivation, and opinions may differ. However, I always require an attribution clause if possible. Though some projects prior to 2022 use MIT.

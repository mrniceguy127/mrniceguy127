### Hi! I want to make a career out of my hobby.

UPDATE 3/5/2021

**Focusing on school/internship for now. Status is where I left off.**

6/18/2021: Slightly more active now. I won't be doing to much with my more ambitious projects though.

Status:
- Ideas also brewing related to RetroArch, though I'm not certain yet.
- mandelbrot-gen: Tinkering... Zooms work.
- I generally like to get started on things before talking about them, but I'm probably going to try and implement an AES encryption algorithm in C# for learning purposes. Not real world use!!!
- ~~osu-wine-install-script: Will soon add script for installing ThePoon's wine patch / other improvements.~~ [Done](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/osu-wine-install-script)!
- Castlevania III Save Password generator. [In Progress](https://github.com/mrniceguy127/castlevania-iii-password-save-gen-c-sharp).
- Too many other ideas!

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- MIT/others: When things aren't black or white.

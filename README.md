### Hi! I want to make a career out of my hobby.

UPDATE 2/19/2021

**Focusing on school for now. Status is where I left off.**

Status:
- Ideas also brewing related to RetroArch, though I'm not certain yet.
- mandelbrot-gen: Tinkering... Zooms work.
- I generally like to get started on things before saying them, but I'm probably going to try and implement an AES encryption algorithm in C# for learning purposes. Not real world applicability!!!
- osu-wine-install-script: Will soon add script for installing ThePoon's wine patch / other improvements.
- Too many ideas in the works too! Like Castlevania III related stuff.

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source work possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation and I generally don't want derivative work to be made proprietary. 
- MIT: When things aren't black or white.

Current Watchlist:
- Linux gaming. Would really like a smoother and less painful experience with that. Tons of games work out of the box, some work with tweaking, and for various reasons others don't work at all. Still dual booting for certain games.
- Wayland with Nvidia proprietary drivers. I run an Nvidia card so this would be nice.
- Just the state of software and open source in general.

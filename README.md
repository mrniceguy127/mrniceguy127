Stuff I'm currently teaching myself:

- Anything related to my current projects

Motivation:
- Programming is fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Career Path

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- MIT/others: When things aren't black or white.

Updates:
- [03/05/2021] Taking a break from my side projects so I can focus on school, co-op, and other life matters.
- [10/18/2021] I'm finally back and able to continue my side projects again.

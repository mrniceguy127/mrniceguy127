### Hi! I want to make a career out of my hobby.

UPDATE 1/26/2021

Status:
- I'm currently trying to improve my proficiency in C# (taking a small break though).
- Ideas also brewing related to RetroArch, though I'm not certain yet.
- mandelbrot-gen: Tinkering... Zooms work.
- ~~Basically just trying to figure out what I want to do for my next project.~~ I think I figured it out, just need to do proper research on the topic. Might use as a means to practice C#.
- osu-wine-install-script: Will soon add script for installing ThePoon's wine patch / other improvements.

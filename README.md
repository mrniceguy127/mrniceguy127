### Hi! I want to make a career out of my hobby.

UPDATE 12/08/2020
- I'm currently trying to improve my proficiency in C# (taking a small break though).
- Ideas brewing related to some CPU stuff again (MIPS implementation?)
- Ideas also brewing related to RetroArch, though I'm not certain yet.
- mandelbrot-gen temporarily on hold.
- Basically just trying to figure out what I want to do for my next project.

Books I'm Reading / Will Read:
- [Go Programming Language, The (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=golang&qid=1635724747&sr=8-9)

Motivation:
- Programming is fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Career path

How I pick licenses:
- GPL v3: As many of my side projects and other open source works as possible. GPL is extremely valuable for learning and cooperation (including my own).
- MIT/others/multi-license: When things aren't black or white. Especially when working with other people where goals, motivation, and opinions may differ.

Updates:
- [11/02/2021] NES emulator is my current focus. I recently finished writing up a [CSV file representing the 6502 instruction set matrix](https://gist.github.com/mrniceguy127/356a06ac20bf72106305e43b2897bc62). Now working on a script to generate a C++ array from the CSV file using AWK, Python, and a shell script.
- [01/05/2022] Focus is back on school and co-op interviews for now. 6502 will have to wait for now. :( 
- [02/26/2022] Finishing the school term and will hopefully have more time after. I'm absolutely dying to finish my 6502 emulation!!
